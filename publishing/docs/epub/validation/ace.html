				<h3>Ace</h3>
				
				<p><a href="https://inclusivepublishing.org/toolbox/accessibility-checker/">Ace by DAISY</a> is a free
					validation tool that checks EPUB publications for accessibility issues.</p>
				
				<p>The Ace tool is restricted in its testing to only what a machine can reliably check. A publication
					that passes Ace validation is not necessarily conformant with any WCAG level. To make a claim of
					conforance to WCAG, maunal inspection is also required to check for issues that a machine cannot
					test. This is where the <a href="#smart">SMART</a> tool fits into the validation process.</p>
