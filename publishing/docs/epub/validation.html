				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p>EPUB publications need to be validated for both conformance to the standard and to accessibility
					guidelines.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="process">
				<h3>Validation Process</h3>
				
				<p>Validation is critical part of ensuring that an EPUB publication is usable, and not just for persons
					with disabilities. There is currently a three-step process to check that a publication conforms to
					the requirements of the EPUB standard and meets WCAG guidelines for accessibility:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Validating the publication using <a href="#epubcheck">EPUBCheck</a> ensures that it conforms to
						the requirements of the EPUB standard.</li>
					<li>Validating the publication using the <a href="#ace">Ace by DAISY</a> tool helps discover accessibility
						issues that can be tested automatically.</li>
					<li>Manually checking the publication using the <a href="#smart">Ace SMART</a> tool ensure that it
						meets all the requirements of WCAG, thereby allowing a conformance claim to be made.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>These steps can be followed for both EPUB 3 and EPUB 2 publications, although the Ace and SMART
					tools are not specifically optimized for checking EPUB 2. Details about each tool are provided in
					the following sections.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="val-note">
					<p class="label" id="val-note">Note</p>
					<p>This process is expected to be simplified in the future as efforts are made to integrate the
						three process into a single application.</p>

				<h3>EPUBCheck</h3>
				
				<p>EPUBCheck is a command line validation tool that automatically checks EPUB publications for
					conformance to the standard. It will report any issues with a publication that are in violation of
					the standard and/or that could cause the publication not to render in reading systems.</p>
				
				<p>Note that EPUBCheck is not complete in everything that can go wrong. It is not able to verify
					whether scripts will negatively affect the accessibility of a publication, for example. It also
					provides only limited validation of some technologies, like CSS, which could cause issues with the
					presentation.</p>
				
				<p>More significantly, it does not include any specific accessibility-related checks. It is for this
					reason that the <a href="#ace">Ace</a> and <a href="#smart">SMART</a> tools also need to be run.</p>
