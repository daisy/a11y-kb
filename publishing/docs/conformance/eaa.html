				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p>The European Accessibility Act sets a common accessibility baseline for publishing ebooks within
					the European Union member states.</p>
				
				<p>Publishers, with some exceptions, will be required to meet these requirements starting in 2025.</p>
			</section>
			
			
			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				
				<p>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is the colloquial name for <a 
					href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj?eliuri=eli:dir:2019:882:oj">Directive (EU) 
					2019/882 2 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on the accessibility
					requirements for products and services</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The act was created in response to the commitments assumed by the European Union (EU) in ratifying
					the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Its goal is to harmonize
					accessibility requirements across various products and services most important to persons with
					disabilities, in particular ebooks.</p>
				
				<p>Prior to the introduction of this act, publishing ebooks in the <abbr
					title="European Union">EU</abbr> required dealing with a patchwork of national accessibility laws.
					The act addresses this pain point for publishers by establishing a common accessibility baseline
					based on the <a href="./wcag.html">W3C's Web Content Accessibility
						Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. The act was introduced in 2019 and member states had until June 28, 2022,
					to enshrine this law into national legislation. (Most members have now enacted such laws, but <a 
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/NIM/?uri=CELEX:32019L0882">review the current 
						implementation status</a> of each for more information.)</p>
				
				<p>Publishers have a phase-in period to begin producing accessible ebooks that ends on June 28, 2025.
					After that date, publications must be accessible, with <a href="#exemptions">some exceptions</a>,
					as noted below.</p>

			<section id="conformance">
				<h3>Conformance</h3>
				
				<p>The conformance requirements for ebooks are defined in <a 
					href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj?eliuri=eli:dir:2019:882:oj#d1e478-100-1">Annex I
					Section IV of the EAA</a>, specifically:</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>(f) E-books:</p>
					<p class="subcls">(i) ensuring that, when an e-book contains audio in addition to text, it then
						provides synchronised text and audio; 7.6.2019 Official Journal of the European Union L 151/103
						EN</p>
					<p class="subcls">(ii) ensuring that e-book digital files do not prevent assistive technology from
						operating properly;</p>
					<p class="subcls">(iii) ensuring access to the content, the navigation of the file content and
						layout including dynamic layout, the provision of the structure, flexibility and choice in the
						presentation of the content;</p>
					<p class="subcls">(iv) allowing alternative renditions of the content and its interoperability with
						a variety of assistive technologies, in such a way that it is perceivable, understandable,
						operable and robust;</p>
					<p class="subcls">(v) making them discoverable by providing information through metadata about
						their accessibility features;</p>
					<p class="subcls">(vi) ensuring that digital rights management measures do not block accessibility
						features.</p>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>The key clause we will review is (iv), which states that the content must be "perceivable,
					understandable, operable and robust." Anyone familiar with WCAG will already be aware that these are
					the same four principles it uses to categorize the needs of users. The similar language is not a
					coincidence. If you go to paragraph 47 of the act, it defines the purpose of each principle
					in the same way as WCAG.</p>
				
				<p>Although this generally informs publishers they need to follow WCAG, the EAA is not specific about
					what conformance means (i.e., what version of WCAG and what level). Instead, you have to follow
					a couple of references to related directives.</p>
				
				<p>The first comes in paragraph 47 itself, which, in defining the four principles, says they are the
					same as defined in <a 
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L2102">Directive (EU)
						2016/2102</a>. That Directive in turn states in paragraph 37 that: <q>the relevant clauses of
							European standard EN 301 549 V1.1.2 (2015-04) should be considered as the minimum means of
							putting [the] principles into practice</q>.</p>
				
				<p>Only when you reach <a 
					href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf">EN
					301 549</a> are the minimum version and conformance requirements spelled out. As EPUB is web content,
					the requirements detailed in Section 9 apply, which according to the latest version of EN 301 549
					requires conformance to WCAG 2.1 at Level AA.</p>
				
				<p>Publishers should therefore consider WCAG 2.1 Level AA as the minimum they need their ebooks to meet
					to be conformant with the EAA, but this is subject to change as the relevant directives are updated.
					Keeping pace with latest version of WCAG is always strongly advised and is a key recommendation of
					the <a href="./epub.html">EPUB Accessibility standard</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The other ebook requirements cited above are also covered if you create EPUBs that conform to the
					EPUB Accessibility standard at WCAG 2.1 Level AA:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Clause (i) is met by providing media overlays to synchronize the text with prerecorded audio.</li>
					<li>Clauses (ii) and (iii) are met by meeting WCAG's requirements.</li>
					<li>Clause (v) is met by meeting the discoverability metadata requirements.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="conf-note">
					<p class="label" id="conf-note">Note</p>
					<p>Refer to the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-eaa-mapping/#annex-I-section-IV">EPUB Accessibility - EU
						Accessibility Act Mapping</a> document produced by the W3C's EPUB 3 Working Group for more
						specific details about how these clauses are met.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>The only requirement not directly met by conforming to the EPUB Accessibility standard is in clause
					(vi). The requirement that digital rights management (DRM) measures not block the accessibility
					of ebooks cannot be enforced by the EPUB Accessibility standard since DRM is normally applied by
					vendors (i.e., it is out of scope of content authoring).</p>
				
				<p>As the EAA is broader in application, including to the providers of bookstores, the act can make
					DRM non-interference a requirement. Checking the interoperability of DRM with assistive
					technologies is typically not a concern for publishers, however, unless they are also directly
					distributing their publications to users with DRM (i.e., they sell through their own bookstore).</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="exemptions">
				<h3>Exemptions</h3>
				
				<p>Although the EAA is intended to apply to all ebooks, it does include a limited set of exemptions
					where production would represent an undue burden for publishers or would require them to change the
					content such that it would alter the basic nature of the work.</p>
				
				<p>The specific wording of these exemptions is as follows:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><q>[t]he requirements and obligations of this Directive should &#8230; not apply to
						microenterprises providing services within the scope of this Directive</q> (paragraph 70),
						where a microenterprise is <q>an enterprise which employs fewer than 10 persons and which 
						has an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 2 million or an annual balance sheet total not
						exceeding EUR 2 million</q> (Article 3, paragraph 23)</li>
					<li>if production would <q>result in the imposition of a disproportionate burden on the economic
						operators concerned</q> (Article 14, paragraph 1 (a))</li>
					<li>if production would <q>require a significant change in a product or service that results in the
						fundamental alteration of its basic nature</q> (Article 14, paragraph 1 (b))</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Although the act allows an exemption for disproportionate burden, it should not be read as absolving
					the publisher of making any effort to make their content accessible. There may be a criterion or
					more of the act that cannot be met, but the publisher should still make all reasonable efforts to
					meet the rest of the requirements. (Refer to paragraph 72 of the act for more information.)</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="dis-note">
					<p class="label" id="dis-note">Note</p>
					<p>Claiming a disproportionate burden requires that a publisher meet the criteria set out in <a
						href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj?eliuri=eli:dir:2019:882:oj#d1e32-115-1">Annex
						VI</a> of the act.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>What would allow a publisher to claim a fundamental alteration exemption for an ebook is less
					clearly defined. This page will be updated whenever evidence of how publishers are using this
					exemption becomes available.</p>
				
				<p>Be aware that claiming any of these exemptions requires publishers to carry out an assessment to
					prove their legitimacy. Although microenterprises are exempt from documenting their assessments,
					they may be requested by regulators to provide the facts that led them to claim the exemption.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="ex-meta-note">
					<p class="label" id="ex-meta-note">Note</p>
					
					<p>The W3C Publishing Maintenance Working Group is expected to soon publish new metadata for EPUB
						that allows publishers to express exemptions in the package document (an 
						<code>a11y:exemption</code> property). A link to the document will be added once it is
						available.</p>
