				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Footnotes and endnotes have proven an impediment to the reading experience because they interrupt the
					narrative flow. When footnotes are placed immediately following the paragraph that references them,
					users had to manually navigate past them each time, as they are typically indistinguishable from text
					content. Even endnotes, grouped at the end of the section, require the user to jump past them.</p>
				
				<p>The HTML5 structural elements, together with the <code>role</code> attribute, provide a means of
					alleviating this problem, by clearly marking individual footnotes and endnotes, and sections of them. Not
					only does this allow accessible user agents to ignore the notes except when followed from their
					referents, but it allows any user agent to handle them more intelligently (e.g., as pop-ups).</p>
				
				<p>Notes placed within the primary narrative should be tagged using the HTML5 <code>aside</code> element (see
					<a href="#ex01">Example 1</a>). This usage ensures that even if their semantics are not
					recognized, the notes will still be treated as secondary content due the nature of the HTML5
					<code>aside</code> element.</p>
				
				<p>Notes that are grouped at the end of a section do not need to be individually tagged as
					<code>aside</code>, but should be grouped using the appropriate footnotes or endnotes semantic (see <a
							href="#ex02">Example 2</a>). Lists are an effective means of representing groups of notes in
					these sections, as they allow users to move through them more effectively (e.g., each list item number
					will typically correspond sequentially to the contained note number, and users should have the ability
					to jump through more than one list item at a time when there are many notes).</p>
				
				<p class="bridgehead">Notes in Tables</p>
				
				<p>If notes occur in a table, avoid placing them in a <code>tfoot</code> element, as it is intended for
					summaries of the columns. Footnotes can follow the table or can be grouped together with the table inside
					a <code>figure</code>. See the <a href="tables.html">Tables section</a> for an example.</p>
				
				<p class="bridgehead">Note References</p>
				
				<p>Note references must be tagged using the HTML5 <code>a</code> element.</p>
				
				<p>Do not use the <code>sup</code> element to superscript note references, as it is redundant presentational
					tagging. The CSS <code>vertical-align</code> property can be set to superscript the <code>a</code>
					elements (see <a href="#ex03">Example 3</a>).</p>
				
				<p class="bridgehead">Back Referencing</p>
				
				<p>Although not specifically required to be accessible, it is good practice to backlink groups of notes to
					their referent locations in the text (see <a href="#ex-04">Example 4</a>). If a user is
					surveying the notes, backlinks will allow them to quickly find the text the note refers to.</p>
