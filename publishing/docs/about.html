				<p>The Accessible Publishing Knowledge Base was originally conceived as a complement to the O'Reilly
					<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/accessible-epub-3/9781449329297/">Accessible EPUB 3</a>
					ebook published in 2012. It was a way to surface all the information that was collected as part of
					authoring that book but that could not all be added to it.</p>
				
				<p>DAISY has continued to develop the site since that time, and it now covers an extensive range of topics
					on creating accessible digital publications. While still primarily rooted in making EPUB 3 publications
					accessible, the site is also a source of accessible practices for EPUB 2 and also provides practical
					guidelines for creating accessible HTML content in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">W3C 
						Audiobooks</a>.</p>
				
				<p>The intervening years have also seen the publication of the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y/">EPUB Accessibility specification</a>, which
					defines a formal framework for checking the accessibility of EPUB 3 publications. This site is now
					a primary source of information for producing content to meet this specification.</p>
