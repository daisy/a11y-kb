				<h3>Definition</h3>
				
				<p class="desc">No accessibility features or content rendering options offered by the reading system,
					device or reading software (including but not limited to the ability to modify or choose text size
					or typeface, word and line spacing, zoom level, text or background color, or use of text-to-speech)
					are limited, disabled, overridden or otherwise unusable with the product EXCEPT – in ONIX 3
					messages only – those specifically noted as subject to restriction or prohibition in 
					&lt;EpubUsageConstraint>.</p>
				<p class="desc">Note that provision of any significant part of the textual content as
					images (ie as pictures of text, rather than as 'text-as-text', and without any textual equivalent)
					or the application of some technical protection measures (DRM), inevitably prevents full use of
					these accessibility options. Code 10 means 'this e-publication is accessible to the full extent
					that the file format and types of content allow, on a specific reading device, by default, without
					necessarily inluding any additions such as textual descriptions of images or enhanced navigation.
					Note that for reflowable e-books, this means code 36 also applies, although code 10 can also be
					used with accessible non-reflowable (fixed-format) e-publications and with audio material. Should
					be used with other codes that describe any additions to enhance the level of accessibility</p>

				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Digital rights management (DRM) restrictions sometimes allow content producers to enable or
					disable features that impact the accessibility of a publication. To meet the criteria, do not
					bundle or distribute publications with restrictions on them that would disable access to the
					content by screen readers.</p>
