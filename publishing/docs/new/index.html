				<p>This page is continuously updated to reflect significant changes to the DAISY Accessible Publishing
					Knowledge Base. For a complete list of changes, refer to the project's <a
						href="https://github.com/daisy/kb/commits/">GitHub commit history</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Changes are listed from most recent to oldest.</p>
				
				<dl class="value">
					<dt>June 2, 2023 &#8212; New layout for categories</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>To make it easier to find information, the list of categories is no longer buried in a
							drop-down menu. The list of categories now occupies the right-hand column of the site
							(this position may change depending on zoom level and device screen size).</p>
						<p>The link to the <a href="../glossary/">glossary</a> is now at the bottom of the page in the
							Site menu, as is the link to the <a href="../topics.html">page that lists all topics</a>.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>May 31, 2023 &#8212; New search box</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>It is no longer necessary to click through to a separate search page to query the knowledge
							base for information. A site search box is now available in the header of every page and is
							reachable from the page landmarks.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>April 19, 2023 &#8212; WCAG parsing requirement</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The forthcoming WCAG 2.2 revision will see <a 
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#parsing">success criterion 4.1.1</a> pass for all HTML
							and XML-based content as it no longer captures accessibility issues that aren't already
							covered by other success criteria. This change will also apply retroactively to WCAG 2.0
							and 2.1.</p>
						
						<p>The knowledge base now reflects this new guidance, advising that parsing errors that
							affect accessibility be reported under their more applicable success criteria. Refer to the
							<a href="../wcag/parsing.html">WCAG explain for 4.1.1</a> for more information.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>April 17, 2023 &#8212; Evaluation metadata</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Now that the EPUB Accessibility 1.1 standard has reached Proposed Recommendation status
							in W3C, the <a href="../metadata/evaluation.html">guidance on reporting conformance</a> now
							reflects the new identifiers used in that document.</p>
						<p>Where the EPUB Accessibility 1.0 specification used <code>idpf.org</code> URLs to indicate
							conformance, the new standard uses easier to write and understand strings. The strings
							also adapt to new versions of WCAG as soon as they are released.</p>
						<p>Publishers are encouraged to begin looking at migrating to the new standard as it should
							become a final recommendation in the next month.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>March 24, 2023 &#8212; <code>pageBreakMarkers</code> and <code>pageNavigation</code>
						accessibility features</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The page describing the <a href="../metadata/schema.org/accessibilityFeature.html">schema.org 
							<code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a> now includes information on the
							<code>pageBreakMarkers</code> and <code>pageNavigation</code> values.</p>
						<p>The <code>pageBreakMarkers</code> value replaces <code>printPageNumbers</code> as more
							and more publications are being created with static page locations that are not tied to a
							print source. The <code>pageNavigation</code> value enables publishers to now identify when
							a publication includes a page list that allows users to access the page break
							locations.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>March 24, 2023 &#8212; <code>pageBreakSource</code> property</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Information about the new <code>pageBreakSource</code> property is now available on the
							<a href="../navigation/pagelist.html">page navigation</a> page. This property is currently
							being incubated as a replacement for using the <code>dc:source</code> and 
							<code>page-source</code> properties.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>November 8, 2022 &#8212; WCAG 2.2 Explainers</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The <a href="../wcag/">WCAG explainers</a> now reflect changes made as WCAG 2.2 transitioned
							from a working draft to a candidate recommendation. These include adding pages for
							<a href="../wcag/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</a> 
							and <a href="../wcag/focus-not-obscured-enhanced.html">Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a>
							success criteria and consolidating <a
								href="../wcag/focus-appearance.html">Focus Appearance</a> to a single success criterion.</p>
						<p>The pages for <a href="../wcag/visible-controls.html">Visual Indicators</a> and 
							<a href="../wcag/page-break-navigation.html">Page Break Navigation</a> now include warnings
							that they will be removed from the KB as they were dropped from WCAG 2.2.</p>
					</dd>
					
					<dt>September 7, 2022 &#8212; Poetry</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A new page is now available discussing techniques for <a href="../html/poetry.html">marking
							up lines of verse</a> using the capabilities that HTML offers.</p>
					</dd>
