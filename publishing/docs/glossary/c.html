						<p><a role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#digital-pub">Digital publications</a> are made up of many
							different files: <a href="h.html#html">HTML</a> documents, images, <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#css">CSS files</a> and scripts, among others. In order to simplify distribution,
							the files are all bundled together in a single container file so <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="u.html#user">users</a> only have to download the one file to obtain the entire
							publication.</p>

						<p><a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub">EPUB</a>, for example, uses <a href="z.html#zip"
								>ZIP</a> as its container format. EPUB files can be opened by any ZIP tools, an
							operation that is made even easier by changing their extension from <code>.epub</code> to
								<code>.zip</code> (i.e., most computer operating systems have built-in tools to open
							files with <code>.zip</code> extensions).</p>

						<p>Another common name for the EPUB container file is the "OCF file" or "OCF Container", as the
							requirements for zipping the content files together is defined in the <a
								href="http://idpf.org/epub3/latest/ocf">EPUB Open Container Format (OCF)</a>
							specification.</p>

						<p>The organization responsible for providing a digital publication to <a role="doc-glossref"

						<p>In <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub3">EPUB 3</a>, a core media type is a file format
							that has to be supported to ensure that publications are readable in whatever <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="#rs">reading system</a> a <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="u.html#user">user</a> happens to use.</p>

						<p>For example, EPUB 3 requires reading systems be able to render <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="x.html#xhtml">XHTML5</a> and <a role="doc-glossref" href="s.html#svg">SVG</a>
							documents, MP3 and MP4 audio, a variety of image formats, etc. Therefore, these are all core
							media types.</p>

						<p>If the <a href="#media-type">media type</a> of a resource is not listed as core, it is
							considered a <a href="#foreign-resource">foreign resource</a> (i.e., reading systems might
							support it, but are not guaranteed to).</p>

						<p>The list of <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html#sec-cmt-supported"
								>core media types supported in EPUB 3</a> is provided in the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-spec.html">EPUB 3 specification</a>.</p>

						<p>The Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language is used to control the presentation of <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="h.html#html">HTML</a> and <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="s.html#svg">SVG</a> documents.</p>

						<p>CSS is used to specify fonts, colours, borders and other display aspects based on a set of
							rules defined by the <a role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#author">author</a>.</p>

						<p>A common complaint with <a role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#digital-pub">digital
								publications</a>, however is that <a role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#rs">reading
								systems</a> do not support, or ignore, author rules, or apply their own. The result is
							that publications often do not look as intended, and differ in appearance from reading
							system to reading system.</p>
