						<p>Digital publications are made up of many different files: HTML documents, images, <a
								href="#css">CSS files</a> and scripts, among others. In order to simplify their
							distribution, they are all bundled together in a single container file.</p>

						<p>EPUB, for example, uses ZIP for its container format. EPUB files can be opened by any ZIP
							tools, an operation that is made even easier by changing their extension from
								<code>.epub</code> to <code>.zip</code> (i.e., most computer operating systems have
							built-in tools to open files with <code>.zip</code> extensions).</p>

						<p>Another common name for the EPUB container file is the "OCF file" or "OCF Container", as the
							requirements for zipping the content files together is defined in the <a
								href="http://idpf.org/epub3/latest/ocf">EPUB Open Container Format (OCF)</a>
							specification.</p>

							variety of image formats, etc. Therefore, these are all core media types of EPUB 3.</p>
