						<p>An assistive technology is a device or software program capable of rendering content in ways
							that facilitate reading by persons with disabilities.</p>

						<p>An assistive technology may be fully integrated into a <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="r.html#rs">reading system</a> (iBooks with VoiceOver) or may work in conjunction
							with hardware and software to provide a reading experience better tailored to the reader's
							preferred modality (e.g., screen-reading software like JAWS and NVDA, content zooming
							technologies and refreshable braille displays).</p>

						<p>The person or organization directly responsible for creating a digital publication and
							ensuring the quality and accessibility of the final product.</p>

						<p>In the context of digital publication specifications and documentation, the "author" does not
							refer to the person who wrote the publication. It is used to avoid personal pronouns
							(specifically "you"), as personal pronouns make translation to other languages more
							complex.</p>
