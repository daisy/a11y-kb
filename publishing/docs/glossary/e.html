						<p>EPUB content documents are what get rendered to readers. They can be in either XHTML5 or SVG.
							Other formats may also be included, but a fallback in one of these two formats is required

						<dfn>EPUB Navigation Document</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The EPUB navigation document provides structural navigation for readers. The document is
							designed to be rendered by reading systems for navigation purposes (i.e., the table of
							contents option offered by the reading system itself), but by using the XHTML5 grammar the
							documents can also be embedded as table of contents within the publication itself.</p>

						<dfn>EPUB Style Sheet</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>EPUB 3 intially defined a baseline set of <a href="c.html#css">CSS</a> that <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#author">authors</a> were encouraged to use and <a
								href="r.html#rs">reading systems</a> to support under the name of "EPUB Style
							Sheets".</p>

						<p>This naming caused confusion, however, as it was sometimes misunderstood as EPUB was defining
							its own version of CSS. As a result, the name is no longer used in the EPUB specifications
							and has been replaced by more general references to CSS.</p>

						<p>In other words, any reference to "EPUB Style Sheet" should be read as synonymous with "CSS
							Style Sheet".</p>
