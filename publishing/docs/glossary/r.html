						<p>Reading system is a term commonly used with EPUB to describe the application that a user uses
							to read their digital publication.</p>

						<p>An EPUB reading system is a device capable of rendering an EPUB. A reading system may be a
							single dedicated device or it could be a combination of hardware and software and assistive
							technology. An iPad on its own is not a reading system, for example, but when iBooks is run
							on it the hardware and software constitute a reading system. Discussions about accessible
							reading systems are complicated by the wide variety of interplay that is possible between
							devices and software.</p>

					<dt id="remoteres">
						<dfn>Remote Resource</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A publication resource that is not included in the container. Audio and video resources are
							allowed to be housed on the Web because of their potential size. Resources referenced in
							package document <code>link</code> elements can also live outside the contianer (e.g.,
							metadata records).</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="rendition">
						<dfn>Rendition</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A rendition of a publication is one presentation of its content.</p>

						<p>All publications consist of one default presentation, but it is technically possible for more
							than one presentation to be bundled together. For example, a digital publication could have
							separate English and French versions, or a fixed layout and reflowable version for readers
							to choose from. EPUB 2 even allows alternative formats, such as a PDF version of the
							content, to be bundled inside the <a role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container"
								>container</a>.</p>

						<p>A publication that, for example, has both English and French versions together in a single
							presentation is not a multiple rendition publication. Each rendition has to be unique
							&#8212; in EPUB, this means that each has its own <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="p.html#package">package document</a>.</p>

						<p>In practice, however, renditions are more theoretical than practical at this time. A means of
							selecting between possible renditions was developed for EPUB 3, but has never gained any
							traction either with publishers or <a role="doc-glossref" href="#rs">reading system</a>
							developers.</p>
