						<p>Reading system is the generic term used in <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub">EPUB</a>
							to describe the application used to read or process a publication.</p>

						<p>A reading system can be a dedicated device like an eInk tablet or could be an application
							(like Kobo Books, Google Play Books and Apple iBooks) that runs in a tablet, phone or on a
							computer.</p>

						<dfn>Remote Resource</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub3">EPUB 3</a>, a remote resource is a <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="#resource">resource</a> that lives on the Web instead inside
								<a role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container">container</a>.</p>

						<p>Audio, video and fonts are examples or resources that are allowed to be located on the Web
							because of their potential size.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="render">
						<dfn>Render</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Render is a presentation-neutral term used to describe how a <a role="doc-glossref"
								href="#rs">reading system</a> makes a <a role="doc-glossref" href="p.html#publication"
								>publication</a> readable for a user.</p>

						<p>For visual reading, for example, rendering entails the visual lay out and styling of the
							content on a screen. For auditory reading, rendering involves playing back pre-recorded
							audio or generating <a role="doc-glossref" href="t.html#tts">text-to-speech</a>
							playback.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="rendition">
						<dfn>Rendition</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>In <a role="doc-glossref" href="e.html#epub3">EPUB 3</a>, a rendition of a publication is one
							presentation of its content.</p>

						<p>All publications consist of one default presentation, but it is technically possible for more
							than one presentation to be bundled together. For example, a digital publication could have
							separate English and French versions, or a fixed layout and reflowable version for readers
							to choose from.</p>

						<p>In practice, however, renditions are more theoretical than practical at this time. A means of
							selecting between possible renditions was developed for EPUB 3, but has never gained any
							traction either with publishers or <a role="doc-glossref" href="#rs">reading system</a>
							developers.</p>
						
						<p>A rendition is not the same things as its possible <a href="#render">renderings</a>. Each
							rendition could be rendered multiple ways (e.g., visually, aurally, tactilely)</p>
					</dd>

					<dt id="resource">
						<dfn>Resource</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Resource is a generic term used to refer to anything used in the rendering of a <a
								role="doc-glossref" href="d.html#digital-pub">digital publication</a>. Resources include
							the files in a <a role="doc-glossref" href="c.html#container">container</a> or anything that
							can be obtained from the web.</p>

						<p>Although it might be simpler to think of resources as "files", the word file is generally
							avoided because publication resources may not exist until they are retrieved (e.g., a script
							might dynamically generate a resource to return to a <a role="doc-glossref" href="r.html#rs"
								>reading system</a>).</p>

						<p>The <a role="doc-glossref" href="a.html#aria">ARIA</a> specification defines roles,
