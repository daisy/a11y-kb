					<dd>
						<p>The DAISY Consortium is an organization that has been advocating for accessible
							publishing practices, and that has developed a talking book format specially designed to
							enable reading by readers with print disabilities. The functionality provided in the
							ANSI/NISO Z39.86 standard maintained by the Consortium has been fully integrated in EPUB
							3.</p>

					<dt id="diagram">DIAGRAM (Digital Image and Graphic Resources for Accessible Materials)</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The DIAGRAM project seeks to make image and graphic content more accessible by defining a
							content model for writing descriptions and including alternate representations. More
							information can be found at the <a href="http://www.diagramcenter.org">DIAGRAM Center
								Web site</a>.</p>

					<dt id="dom">DOM (Document Object Model)</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The document object model is how the markup content you create gets internalized by a
							processing agent such as a reading system or browser. Instead of tags and attributes,
							the DOM is typically likened to a tree full of branches, where each branch represents
							the parent/child relationships of the document.</p>
						<p>When talking about how reading system and assistive technologies interact with content,
							it is more appropriate to relate behaviors to the DOM, since the DOM is not necessarily
							an exact representation of the originating content (e.g., a reading system may
							standardize the HTML markup as it process a document or an assistive technology may
							enahnce the information to facilitate rendering and interaction).</p>
