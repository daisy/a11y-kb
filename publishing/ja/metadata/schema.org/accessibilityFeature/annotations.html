				<p>The <a 
					href="https://w3c.github.io/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#annotations"><code>annotations</code> 
					value</a> is used to indicate that a publication comes with explanatory annotations that
					improve the accessibility of the work (i.e., the value should not be used where the
					annotations are designed for general use, such as in annotated teacher's editions or
					exercises with explanatory notes).</p>
				
				<p>Examples of annotations with an accessibility benefit could include extended descriptions
					for images, plain language explanations of complex theorems, and text identifiers for
					visual cues.</p>
				
				<p>Annotations can either be part of text of a publication or can be authored in a separate
					technology such as Web Annotations.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="anno-note">
					<p id="anno-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>The <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/oa">Open Annotation in EPUB</a> specification
						is not currently known to be supported in any reading systems. A proposal is expected
						to be adopted to include <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/1109">accessible
							annotations in ARIA 1.3</a>, however. As a result, this value is rarely applicable
						to EPUB publications at this time.</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>Do not use this value for ruby annotations. See the <a href="#rubyAnnotations"
					><code>rubyAnnotations</code> value</a> instead.</p>
