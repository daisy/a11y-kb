				<h3>readingOrder</h3>
				
				<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#readingOrder"><code>readingOrder</code> 
					value</a> is used to indicate that there is a logical reading order to the text of a publication.</p>
				
				<p>The logical reading order is the progression from one element of content to the next (e.g., a
					heading for a chapter is followed by the first paragraph and so on). When elements are out
					of order in the markup and styled to appear linear, assistive technologies will present them
					to users in the incorrect order.</p>
				
				<p>The logical reading order is also established by ensuring that primary content can be
					distinguished from secondary. The use of HTML elements like <code>figure</code> and
					<code>aside</code> helps identify secondary content, allowing users to skip over it if
					they choose.</p>
				
				<p>Fixed-layout publications tend to be the most problematic due to the fixed positioning of
					elements and having to represent secondary content that spans two pages, but it is possible
					for fixed layouts to have a logical reading progression if care is taken.</p>
				
				<p>See the <a href="../../html/order.html">logical reading order knowledge base page</a> for
					more information.</p>
