				<h3>ttsMarkup</h3>
				
				<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#ttsMarkup"><code>ttsMarkup</code>
					value</a> is used to indicate that a publication's text has been enhanced with additional
					phonetic markup to improve text-to-speech (TTS) playback.</p>
				
				<p>Synthetic speech engines often struggle to render complex words and heteronyms (words that
					are spelled the same but sound different). The result is that it can be very difficult for
					users who cannot see the text to understand what is being read out.</p>
				
				<p>The <a href="../../text-to-speech/ssml.html">SSML markup language</a> allows the phonetic
					renderings of words to be included in the markup of publications to improve rendering, for
					example. PLS pronunciation lexicons similarly allow libraries of phonetic pronunciations to
					be attached to HTML content.</p>
