				<h3>unlocked</h3>
				
				<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#unlocked"><code>unlocked</code>
					value</a> is used to indicate that no digital rights management (DRM) or other content
					restriction protocols are applied to the content.</p>
				
				<p>DRM schemes are often applied to digital publications to protect them from being copied, but
					these schemes, or the rights applied to the content, can sometimes interfere with the
					ability of assistive technologies to access or play back the text.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="un-note">
					<p id="un-note" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>It is often vendors who apply DRM schemes to publications before distributing them to
						users. As a result, before setting this value, authors need to ensure that the
						publication will not subsequently have DRM applied. The pubication has to be guaranteed
						to be unlocked after distribution.</p>
